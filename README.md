Enhancement: React-based User Groups Injection in Sitecore Content Hub UI

🎉 Introducing a revamped React component for the Sitecore Content Hub!

Transitioned from vanilla JS to a React framework for our user group display functionality.
The new component dynamically fetches and displays user groups based on a user's membership, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Incorporated the MUI (Material-UI) framework for visually pleasing UI components.
Optimized with useEffect and useRef hooks to prevent redundant injections and ensure optimal performance.
Added hover effects and enhanced styling for a more intuitive and user-friendly dropdown menu.
The dropdown gracefully integrates with the existing Sitecore UI, appearing adjacent to the 'Profile and settings' link.
For those who've been following our journey, this is the React transformation of the component we discussed in our previous blog post. It's like we've added a dash of secret sauce to our already delectable dish! 🍲🌟
